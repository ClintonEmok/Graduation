# Project State

**Project:** Adaptive Space-Time Cube
**Core Value:** Users can visually compare uniform vs adaptive time mapping to understand how local density-based time scaling reveals patterns hidden in traditional Space-Time Cubes.
**Current Phase:** 1 - Core 3D Visualization

## Current Position

**Plan:** Phase 1 (Core 3D Visualization)
**Goal:** Users can view and navigate the 3D environment with mock data.
**Status:** **Ready to Start**

```
[ ] Phase 1: Core 3D
[ ] Phase 2: Temporal
[ ] Phase 3: Adaptive Logic
[ ] Phase 4: Adaptive Viz
[ ] Phase 5: Data Backend
[ ] Phase 6: Filtering
[ ] Phase 7: Coordinated
[ ] Phase 8: Logging
[ ] Phase 9: Study Flow
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Requirement Coverage | 100% | 100% |
| Phase Completion | 0/9 | 9/9 |

## Context & Decisions

- **Roadmap Structure:** 9 phases selected ("Comprehensive" depth) to isolate complex features (Adaptive Scaling, Real Data, Coordinated Views) into manageable work units.
- **Mock Data First:** Phases 1-4 will use mock data to validate the adaptive algorithm and UI before integrating the complex Chicago crime dataset in Phase 5.
- **Study-Driven:** The final two phases focus exclusively on the user study infrastructure, ensuring the research goals are met after the technical system is solid.

## Session Continuity

**Last Action:** Created initial Roadmap and State files.
**Next Step:** Begin execution of Phase 1 (Core 3D Visualization).
