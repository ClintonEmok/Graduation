# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Users compare uniform vs adaptive time mapping to reveal hidden spatiotemporal patterns.
**Current focus:** v2.1 refactoring and decomposition planning based on `.planning/REFACTORING-PLAN.md`.

## Current Position

Phase: **46 of 51** (Guardrails and Baselines)
Plan: **1 of 3** in current phase
Status: **In progress**
Last activity: 2026-03-06 - Completed 46-01-PLAN.md baseline and guardrail setup.

Progress: **███████████████████░** 165/169 plans complete (97.6%)

## Milestone Status

- v1.0: Complete (2026-02-07)
- v1.1: Complete (2026-02-22)
- v1.2: Complete (2026-03-02)
- v1.3: Complete (2026-03-04)
- v2.0: 3/3 phases complete
- v2.1: 1/6 phases started (Phase 46 underway)

## Decisions

- Redefined v2.0 scope to a single objective: ship a 3D version of timeline-test functionality.
- Deferred broader spatial-constraint and cross-view diagnostic ambitions to later milestones.
- Kept continuous phase numbering, with v2.0 now spanning phases 43-45.
- Kept parity-critical warp/remap orchestration route-local inside `src/app/timeline-test-3d/lib` for CUBE-09 isolation.
- Standardized `/timeline-test-3d` on one canonical domain pipeline (`useCrimeData` -> `useDataStore` + `computeMaps`) to avoid dual-source drift.
- Mapped 3D slice percent values through domain epoch conversion plus adaptive warp sampling so 3D slice planes align with point Y positions.
- Reused shared `useSliceSelectionStore` and `setActiveSlice` in 3D handlers so timeline panel and 3D selection state stay synchronized.
- Used shared slice-adjustment utilities (`adjustBoundary`, `resolveSnapIntervalSec`) in 3D boundary dragging to preserve snapping semantics.
- Kept warp intervals in a dedicated `WarpSlices3D` overlay to separate annotation slice and warp slice interaction styling.
- Fixed NaN propagation from BurstList click: normalized burst window ranges before passing to focusTimelineRange, hardened DualTimeline coordinate/date calculations to gracefully handle invalid startup values.
- Mirrored suggestion UI components into `src/app/timeline-test-3d/components` to keep 3D suggestion parity route-local instead of cross-importing from timeslicing.
- Kept `accept-full-auto-package` event contract unchanged in 3D so package acceptance behavior remains aligned with existing orchestration.
- Adopted refactoring sequencing from `.planning/REFACTORING-PLAN.md`: guardrails -> dead code cleanup -> API stabilization -> timeline/query/store decomposition.
- Added a deterministic baseline capture workflow (`node scripts/capture-refactor-baseline.mjs --write`) to persist line/size and hot-path timing metrics before refactors.
- Added `Refactor Guardrails` PR checklist requirements to enforce behavior parity, baseline comparison, regression coverage, and debug-log cleanup in phases 47-51.
