# Milestone v1.1: Manual Timeslicing

**Status:** 🚧 In Planning
**Previous:** v1.0 Thesis Prototype
**Focus:** Timeline-based manual region selection and management

## Goal

Transform the timeline from a passive navigation instrument into an active analysis tool where users manually create, visualize, and adjust time regions based on event density patterns.

## Core Value

Users can manually segment the timeline into meaningful time regions by visually identifying density patterns and precisely adjusting region boundaries through direct manipulation.

## Key Capabilities

1. **Visual Density Regions** - Timeline renders high/low density areas clearly
2. **Manual Slice Creation** - Click or drag to create new time regions
3. **Boundary Adjustment** - Drag handles to fine-tune slice edges
4. **Multi-Slice Support** - Overlapping and adjacent regions
5. **Slice Metadata** - Names, colors, notes per region
6. **Timeline-Only Scope** - No 2D/3D integration yet (comes in v1.2+)

## Out of Scope (v1.1)

- 2D/3D visualization of slices (deferred to v1.2)
- Semi-automated suggestions (v1.2)
- Fully automated generation (v1.3)
- Cross-view synchronization

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can visually identify density regions on timeline
- [ ] User can create slices with single click or drag gesture
- [ ] User can adjust slice start/end with drag handles
- [ ] Multiple slices can coexist (overlap or separate)
- [ ] Each slice has editable metadata (name, color)
- [ ] Slices persist during session
- [ ] Intuitive visual feedback during all interactions

## Architecture Notes

- Build on existing Visx/D3 timeline (Phase 21)
- Leverage existing density data from adaptive store (Phase 25)
- New store: `useManualSliceStore` for slice state
- Timeline becomes the primary interaction surface
- "Timeline is the engine" - all logic timeline-centric
