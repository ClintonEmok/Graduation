<objective>
Fix critical UX issues in the Suggestion UI - quick wins that significantly improve usability.

Purpose: Address the most impactful usability gaps identified in UX analysis.
</objective>

<context>
Current state:
- Epoch seconds displayed raw in boundary editing (unreadable)
- No visual preview when hovering suggestions
- No animations on card transitions

These are quick fixes that don't require architectural changes.
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Format epoch seconds as readable dates</name>
  <files>src/app/timeslicing/components/SuggestionCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
    In the boundary editing view (line 264 area), convert epoch seconds to readable dates:
    1. Add a formatDate function or import from SuggestionPanel
    2. Display boundaries as "Jan 15, 2005" format instead of raw epoch
    3. Keep epoch value in the input but show formatted date as label/placeholder
    4. Also fix the data preview section to show formatted dates
  </action>
  <verify>Boundaries show as readable dates like "Jan 15, 2005"</verify>
  <done>Epoch seconds converted to human-readable dates in all displays</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add timeline hover preview for suggestions</name>
  <files>src/app/timeslicing/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    When user hovers over a suggestion card, show a visual preview on the timeline:
    1. Add hover state tracking to SuggestionCard (useSuggestionStore or local state)
    2. When hovering warp profile: highlight the intervals on the timeline axis
    3. When hovering interval boundary: show vertical lines at boundary positions
    4. Use a subtle highlight layer that doesn't interfere with existing timeline
    5. Remove preview on mouse leave
  </action>
  <verify>Hovering a suggestion shows visual indicator on timeline</verify>
  <done>Timeline provides visual feedback while browsing suggestions</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add smooth animations for card transitions</name>
  <files>src/app/timeslicing/components/SuggestionCard.tsx, src/app/timeslicing/components/SuggestionPanel.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Add animations for better UX:
    1. Cards fade in when they appear (CSS animation or Framer Motion)
    2. Cards fade out smoothly when accepted/rejected
    3. Add transition: all 200ms ease to card container
    4. Animate the pending→processed section move
  </action>
  <verify>Smooth fade animations on card appearance and removal</verify>
  <done>UI feels polished with smooth transitions</done>
</task>
