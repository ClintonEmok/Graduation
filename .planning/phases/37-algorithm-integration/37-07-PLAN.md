<objective>
Make suggestion cards collapsible - hide/show the list of intervals within each card.

Purpose: Improve scannability when there are many suggestions by letting users collapse cards they don't need to examine.
</objective>

<context>
Current state:
- All suggestion cards show full interval/boundary details
- With multiple suggestions, list becomes long and hard to scan

This adds a collapse/expand toggle to each card.
</context>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add collapsible interval list to suggestion cards</name>
  <files>src/app/timeslicing/components/SuggestionCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Make suggestion cards collapsible:
    1. Add isCollapsed state to SuggestionCard (default: false)
    2. Add collapse/expand toggle button (chevron icon) next to type badge
    3. When collapsed:
       - Show only: type badge, confidence, interval/boundary count
       - Hide: interval list, action buttons
    4. When expanded: show full content as before
    5. Add smooth height animation for expand/collapse
    6. Show "Show details" / "Hide details" label or icon
  </action>
  <verify>Clicking collapse button hides/shows interval details</verify>
  <done>Cards are collapsible for better list management</done>
</task>
