<current_state>
We have reopened Phase 15 to refactor the Time Slices UX. The goal is to replace raw number inputs with Date Pickers and support "Range Slices" (slabs of time) in addition to point slices.

We have created the plans (15-04 and 15-05) and updated the roadmap. We are ready to execute Plan 15-04.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Created `15-04-PLAN.md`: Refactor Time Slice UX to use Date/Range inputs.
- Created `15-05-PLAN.md`: Implement Range Visualization & Shader logic.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` and `STATE.md` to reflect the new plans and reopened phase status.
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- **Plan 15-04**: Execute refactor of `SliceManagerUI` and `useSliceStore` (Dependencies: `date-fns`, `react-day-picker`).
- **Plan 15-05**: Implement 3D rendering of ranges (box geometry) and update ghosting shader to handle ranges.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- **UX Change**: Switched from normalized 0-100 sliders to Date Pickers for better usability.
- **Data Model**: Slices now have a `type` ('point' | 'range') to support both single timestamps and intervals.
- **Wave Execution**: Plans 15-04 and 15-05 are split into Wave 1 and Wave 2 respectively to ensure the store/UI refactor is stable before complicating the shader logic.

<context>
The planning is done. The next step is pure execution. We need to run the executor for Plan 15-04.
