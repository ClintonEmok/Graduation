### v1.2 Semi-Automated Timeslicing Workflows

**Goal:** AI-assisted timeslicing where the system proposes warp profiles and interval candidates for user confirmation.

**Terminology note:** In this project, timeslicing refers to adaptive time warping (already supports density-driven and user-authored warp sources). Slice workflows are built on top of timeslicing and manage interval suggestions/review.

**Key Features:**
- System suggests warp profiles (candidate non-uniform warp slices/weights)
- System suggests interval boundaries based on density peaks/events under the current warp
- Context-aware suggestions scoped by active data context (e.g., crime type/category, filters, selected cohorts)
- User reviews and adjusts both warp proposals and interval proposals
- "Accept/Modify/Reject" workflow
- Confidence scores for suggestions and profile quality

**Phases:** 35-37

**Phase 36: Suggestion Generation Algorithms**
Plans:
- [x] 36-01-PLAN.md — Confidence scoring module
- [x] 36-02-PLAN.md — Warp profile generation algorithms
- [x] 36-03-PLAN.md — Interval boundary detection algorithms
- [x] 36-04-PLAN.md — Integration with useSuggestionGenerator

### Phase 37: Algorithm Integration

**Goal:** Connect the suggestion algorithms (Phase 36) to the UI (Phase 35) for complete review/approval workflow.

**Key Features:**
- Generation triggers: Manual Generate button + auto-regeneration on filter changes (500ms debounce)
- User-configurable suggestion counts (default: 3 warp profiles, 3 interval boundaries)
- Accept workflow: Creates actual warp slices and time slices on timeline
- Modify workflow: Inline editing for suggestion parameters
- Visual distinction: Colors and badges for warp profiles vs interval boundaries

**Plans:** 2 plans
- [x] 37-01-PLAN.md — Generation triggers & auto-regeneration
- [x] 37-02-PLAN.md — Accept/modify workflow integration

**Gap Closure Plans:**
- [ ] 37-03-PLAN.md — UX quick fixes (dates, preview, animations)
- [ ] 37-04-PLAN.md — Interaction improvements (undo, keyboard, collapse)
- [ ] 37-05-PLAN.md — Bulk actions & presets
- [ ] 37-06-PLAN.md — Comparison, tooltips & history
- [ ] 37-07-PLAN.md — Collapsible suggestion cards
- [ ] 37-08-PLAN.md — Single warp constraint & active indicator
- [ ] 37-09-PLAN.md — Toasts, confidence filter, error handling

**Phase 37: Review/Approval Workflows** (planned)

### v1.3 Fully Automated Timeslicing Workflows

**Goal:** Optimal automatic timeslicing with full warp + interval generation and user review.

**Key Features:**
- System creates complete warp profile and interval set automatically
- Optimization for coverage, relevance, minimal overlap, and temporal continuity
- Context-aware optimization per active investigation context (e.g., burglary-only, violent-crime-only, mixed comparisons)
- User reviews and fine-tunes generated outputs
- Multiple algorithm options (density-based, event-based, etc.)

**Phases:** 40-42 (planned)

### v2.0 Spatially-Constrained 3D Timeslicing (future)

**Goal:** Extend timeslicing to account for spatial constraints in the 3D space-time cube.

**Key Features:**
- Warp proposals constrained by spatial regions and movement patterns
- Cross-view validation between timeline, 2D map, and 3D cube
- Spatially-aware interval generation (not timeline-only)
- Context-aware spatial constraints (crime-type-conditioned hot zones, patrol regions, neighborhood boundaries)
- User review with spatial diagnostics (coverage by area/cluster)
